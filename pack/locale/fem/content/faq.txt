Here I list all questions that come to my mind regarding Forevermetin2

[ TOOL ]
Q1: How do I update Forever Metin2?
        During an update, the tool shows a question mark button. At the top
        left is the update button. However, It's there so you can update live.

Q2: Can I minimize the tool?
        Yes, ESC or Doppelclick Forevermetin2 Title.

03: How can i close feedback window?
        Doppleclick the Title.

Q4: What are all these text files for?
        So that you can translate this yourself into your language. Or you
        are welcome to correct, google translator is terrible. The tool accesses
        this content and plays it back. If these files do not exist, some things do
        not work. With later updates I will see how I can do this differently.

[ DLL'S ]
Q1: How do I get dll's that I don't have?
        You will get these dll's over time.

Q2: What do i need the dll's for?
        There are different download links, and I always update them.

Q3: But why a dll?
        First of all for fun, secondly really practical and clean.

Kind regards
