Hello my dear reader

Even if you shouldn't say something like that, I will say it anyway because
it corresponds to the truth in our beautiful community Metin2. Hardly anyone
will read this or read it to the end, but what the heck maybe there are some
who do it anyway.

The work that I have put into Forevermetin2 will seem to some coders to be
little, but I can promise you it is a lot of patience and love, as with many few
releases of the entire metin2 scene.

I don't want to say that I am better than you, or than he or she, because no
one is better than the other no, that's not my point. The point is, I rarely see
that in the Metin2 scene, and if there is, it will be taken away. Of course there
are people who keep the metin2 scene alive, and I would like to thank them
very much. 

If you like Forevermetin2 and you want to donate something to improve it,
you are very welcome to do it. Just get in touch with me.

Best regards
Ace
