[Content]
The content should be a .exe file that you should somehow execute, or rather
have something installed.
 
[Own Experience]
I tried to install it, and it also installed something, but not what I wanted, or just
some of what I wanted. So I let it be.

[Disclaimer]
I am not liable for damage to your PC or other devices that come into contact 
with this file. Once you have downloaded it, you are responsible for checking 
the file again. Nothing happened to me, otherwise I would have stated it.
