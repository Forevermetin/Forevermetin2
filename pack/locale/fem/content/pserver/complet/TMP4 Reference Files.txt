Metin2 TMP4 Reference Files (Global)

The files come from Metin2Dev, and are recommended. Virusscan is not
necessary because metin2dev does not allow viruses.

Complete package.

[Own Experience]
I've worked on these files from time to time and they mostly ran smoothly. 
The files are highly recommended as base files, but work is required.

[Disclaimer]
This is not a "reupload". Everything you will find, you will find on metin2dev. 
In my opinion, a virus scan is not necessary, since TMP4 would have been
blocked long ago if it planned to do something like that.
