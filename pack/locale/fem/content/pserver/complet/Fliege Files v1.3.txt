[Own Experience]
I've worked with a lot of files, but I didn't find any good ones in the
German speaking forums. In the German-speaking community, these
files are a good basis. What I must have said is you have to be careful
with it. There are many things that have to or should be fixed, but for
basis files, in order to start from 0 why not :)

[Disclaimer]
I am not responsible for damaged devices, stolen accounts, or hacked
identities. Everything that is in this file or exe is in www. to find. these
are original files, I haven't changed them. There is a VirusTotal report, I
had it checked by

    - www.virustotal.com

I have had the download link checked. Please see the download link
and it is best to check it again yourself. 

The file was packed with winrar / Tuesday, 17th. March 2020 
From then on the file will not come from forevermetin2, but from a
third party. Newer versions should definitely be checked more closely

And last but not least: I don't give any support.

Best regards
