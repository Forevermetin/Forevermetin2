Metin2 Kori-files (DE-GERMAN)

This is the 1.5 version of Kori. I ask you to always carry out a virus scan. 
I will give you one, but 2 times control is better than 1 time.

[Own Experience]
I've never really worked with these files, but let's say they were stable.
What keeps me from using such files is the origin of these files. Leaks etc. are
not excluded, but hello, I am not familiar with codes, so test them yourself and
give feedback.

[Disclaimer]
Everything that is in this .exe file can be found on the worldwide web. I haven't
changed it, which means what's in there doesn't come from me. I am not liable 
for damage to your PC, so I ask you for the 2nd time to do your own virus scan. I
am not responsible for this link either, it is a kind of forwarding and can be
reported at any time and deleted immediately. It will only be deleted if you are the
owner of this pack, and you know in detail what it is, or proof that it belongs to
you.

The file was packed with winrar / Tuesday, 17th. March 2020 
From then on the file will not come from forevermetin2, but from a third party.
Newer versions should definitely be checked more closely
