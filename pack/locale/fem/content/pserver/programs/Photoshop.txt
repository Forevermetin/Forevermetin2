It doesn't work without Photoshop, because that's a must if 
you're a designer, mapper or even a server administrator.

Photoshop 1 is enough for our metin2 purposes if it even exists. 
But so that we can also edit and export DDS files and all others
it is best to use Photoshop CC 15.

Download Photoshop CC 15 here:
https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/photoshop

Select Adobe Photoshop CC 15 if you can and copy this file:

   - /export photoshop cc15

in the original path from program.

Before you copy the file in there, you should rename it to:

   - photoshop_cc15_amtlib.dll (exported file)
   - amtlib.dll (rename it to this)

make a backup of your old amtlib.dll file and replace it with the new one.
