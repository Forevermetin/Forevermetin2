With this program I did the following myself or I do the following with it:

 - Open tga file, edit and save
   if you edit the tga via Photoshop they are not transparent.
   
 - Edit and export background images
   There are cool effects that you can apply.
 
of course these are not the only features of this program. Most of them even 
started to design with paint.net and gimp and these programs are still used
today.
