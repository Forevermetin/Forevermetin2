Ingame Map Editor  (DE-GERMAN)

Whether you can call this a tool, I can not say exactly, but ingame you have a kind
of GUI where you can set everything. Call via a shortcut such as F8 or implement
it directly in your game.py. This file must be called mapeditor.py for the GUI to
appear.

[Own Experience]
I like this Python script. Working with it is also fun, but I haven't used 
it for a very long time. To finish the map, i.e. details etc, I can really
recommend it. Try it for yourself. Copy your property folder and paste 
it into map_object_editor/
