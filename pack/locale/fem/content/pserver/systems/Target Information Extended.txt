Target Information Extended

I downloaded this system from metin2downloads. the file was neither created 
by me nor repackaged. I think most people are aware of what kind of system this
is, and for those who don't know it, a little explanation is enough. 

Through this system, players can right-click on monsters, and between of the
name and live there is a question sign. if you click on it, the information about this
monster appears, such as what it drops.
