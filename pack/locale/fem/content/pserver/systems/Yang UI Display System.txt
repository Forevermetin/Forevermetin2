Yang UI Display System

I have had this system with me for a long time under the todo list. Where I got it
from or got it.. now.. maybe turkmmo, or metin2downloads... in any case, the
language in .py is Turkish

Through this system you get a small and nice gui at the bottom right. you can
show and hide them, and you can see how much yang you drop. Otherwise, yang
drop will only be displayed there.

This file contains only text and image files.

[Own Experience]
I built it into myself, and I had no problems with it. this system is therefore 
stored locally in forevermetin2 because I will always use it myself. It is, and 
sees and gives one who is playing a good oldschool feeling.
