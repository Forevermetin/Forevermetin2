The creation of notes:
I built in this function because I first had to create a .txt and open it with notpad.
This note function saved me time and I could write down my ideas immediately
without forgetting them. Whoever wants to use it should  do it and whoever
doesn't shouldn't. I would be happy if it is used :)

And that's how it works:

[ 1 ]
Enter your note here in the [Create Note] box. (This file and all other files are
loaded and saved using the same principle.)

[ 2 ]
Enter the name for your note in the input box without a file extension.  All notes
are saved with the file extension .txt, all other extensions are not displayed.

[ 3 ]
Press enter on your keyboard and save your note. If there is already a note with
the same name, it can be opened and edited.
