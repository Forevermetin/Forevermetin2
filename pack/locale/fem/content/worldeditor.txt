Foreword
=========
First of all a big thank you to MartySama for the time he invests 
in the community. It is not self-evident that so much time is offered
for free. Few do anything for the community, and he's definitely one
who's welcome on any forum.

Information about this WorldEditor
=================================
You can find a lot of information in the above thread by MartySama.
I give little support to WorldEditor Remix bugs etc as most of it may 
need coding and tweaking. In any case, 

Final word
==========
v44 is better than its predecessors and you can work well with it.
Of course it's even better if you improvise and don't open a thread 
for every error. For example, you can also create a pyramid with
WorldEditor Brush if you don't have any objects. So be creative and
let your imagination run wild. In this sense, have fun!


Best regards
