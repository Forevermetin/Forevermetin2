How to use this feature:

[ STEP 1 ]
For example, I want to have exported the "property" 
of a map, first I click on Find Property button. I enter the following in the source input:

 - D:/ymir work/property

or depending on where my property folder is located.
after I've done that, I click these question mark Button
to see if this path exists or not. if you have worldeditor
in drive D, and all folders are there, you can copy my
path and test it. 

[ STEP 2 ]
I enter my map in the second input field and where it
is located. e.g.

 - D:\ymir work\metin2_map_c1

Or I click on Map Path Label and a search window 
pops up. Also there I check whether it is found, or 
even exists.

[ STEP 3 ]
Click on the Berserk button. Now wait until the tool
has found and copied everything. The file can then 
be found where the Forevermetin2.exe is located.

Kind regards
Ace
