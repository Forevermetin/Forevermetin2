WorldEditor installation

Well, you've made the first step and almost finished setting up the "WE". 
If you have Forevermetin2 in drive (D), please disregard point 1.

[ Set up WorldEditor ]
   All you need is a drive bearing the letter (D). You don't have to create one,
   a USB stick is sufficient. With the new WorldEditor's you don't have to.
   However, I recommend that you work with a (D) drive. How to change drive
   letters is shown below. Please do not make any other changes if you lack
   experience.

[ Get started with WorldEditor ]
   The WorldEditor you created is still empty. To change that download
   worldeditor clean or worldeditor pro. If you need help please see the
   WorldEditor Section. You can select one of the available world editors
   and start mapping. 

Should you find any errors or missing files, please let me know.

Kind regards
