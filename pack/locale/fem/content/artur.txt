Artur aka KiLL MoveS.

I have always admired the way he works and moves forward. Whether for
mapping or coding. You have to see his maps. The art maps that I mean are
also public but not the kind of maps you find on servers that have bought it
from him. As I noticed, Artur works with very large maps and his style is
unique. Who of you knows the old Metin2 Global or Global from Tirez, knows
what I'm talking about. I dedicate this text to him as a thank you for his help
whenever I needed it and his inspiration. 

Who knows, if anyone even reads this, maybe they can code a few little 
things for us, which I can then incorporate into forevermetin2.

I really like a map from him, which is of course also public and old.

Waterfall Map
with this command you can export the map (/export waterfall)
