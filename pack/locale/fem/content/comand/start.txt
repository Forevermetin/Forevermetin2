List of Start Comands:
You can edit and save files directly.
The comands starts with "/"

Example: /start worldeditor

Start:
 > worldeditor
 

There will be more possibilities in the future. Since not all have the
same folders as me, and thus the programs will not work error-free
I think about something, so that you can always change the paths.
Maybe a public dll.
