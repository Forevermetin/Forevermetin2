List of Patch Comands:
You can patch the current files that i find on metin2dev.
The comands starts with "/"

Note:
These commands can temporarily only be used by users who
have a data.dll from me. The standard DLL does not include any
downloads.

Example: /patch bgm

Metin2 Client
=============
 > bgm
 > effect
 > environment
 > guild
 > icon
 > item
 > locale
 > map
 > monster
 > monster2
 > npc
 > npc_mount
 > npc_pet
 > npc2
 > pc
 > pc2
 > pc3
 > property
 > root
 > season1
 > season2
 > sound
 > special
 > terrainmaps
 > textureset
 > tree
 > ui
 > uiscript
 > zone

The files will be downloadet in this path (metin2/...)

Once I find a good patch server, multiple users can use it. Maybe
someone will sponsor us a patch server, then you can all have the
Data.dll that contains all these important downloads.

Forevermetin2
==============
 > worldeditor clean 
   (will be adjusted and will come later.)

 > worldeditor officiall 
   (will be adjusted and will come later.)

You also need a login and data.dll for these two. These 2 patches can
be found in the original on metin2dev.
