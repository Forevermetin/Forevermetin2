Welcome to FAQ 12

Removing individual objects on the map is possible on fastest via WorldEditor.
You can also do everything highlight and then press DELETE. Most of the time,
you only want to remove one object completely, and the problem is that our
objects are placed all over the map, and around it there is something else. The
fastest method would not be WorldEditor or direct, but Property.

Removing objects one by one is the way to do it:
--------------------------------------------

Let's just say that I've been all over the desert
	
     > "cactus_01.prb" placed. 

WorldEditor accesses the Property The .prb file then accesses to 

     > "d:/ymir work/zone/myfile.gr2". 

This is what my "cactus_01.prb".
-----------------------------
    YPRT
    3031989151
    building file "d:/ymir work/zone/n/
    desert/cactus_01.gr2"
    property name "cactus_01"
    propertytype "Building"
    shadowflag "1"

Now, if we were to delete the object from "zone", that is is the object our .prb
accesses, and that is in my case "cactus_01.prb"

 - "d:/ymir work/zone/n/desert/cactus_01.gr2"

So WorldEditor will still show the file but invisible.

this is how to remove at the next WorldEditor start the object completely from
the map. 

So once again:
-------------
 - Backup from the *.prb 		(property/cactus_01.prb)
 - Delete the *.prb			(property/cactus_01.prb)
 - Restart WorldEditor
 - Load your map
 - Save the map

After you have saved the map, you can use the object normally again, and it will
no longer appear on the map.

There is another way to get objects but this method sticks.
