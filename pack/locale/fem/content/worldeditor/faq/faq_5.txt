Which is the best to create a minimap 

I honestly can not say, because all versions crashed with me after I 
wanted to create a minimap for my 10x10 map. I can give a very important 
tip and that is that before you make the minimap, you should delete the
environment in the map setting and leave it empty. Your map should not 
have a skybox or rather.

Like:
	- Environment	C1.msenv
To:
	- Environment

Create minimap this is how it works with "MartySama WorldEditor"
-------------------------------------------------------------
 - Press the "T" key in WorldEditor
 - Now press Insert or F6
 - CTRL + S
 - Save Atlasmap

Two mini maps are created
 - Large
 - Small

The large minimap will be to big for your atlas so I recommend resizing 
it. As an an example I'll take a 2 x 2 map. I export one 2 x 2 minimap, this 
has the size:

512 x 512 well, the best thing I can do is make the minimap smaller a little 
bit like: 256 x 256 would be a good size.

Tipps
-----
1) To export a nicer minimap, I want you to enlarge the textures in textureset.
Say i have a mountain texture and this is 3 x 3, now:

I set the texture to [0.5 x 0.5] or [1.0 x 1.0]

2) after you have finished your map, it is best to reload it without fog or
anything else. Or rather, restart WorldEditor.
