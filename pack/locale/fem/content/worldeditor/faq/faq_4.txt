Welcome to FAQ 4

Edit standard maps how it works
------------------------------
First said you need here for the latest official client, but also an old client
goes. The files listed must be unpacked and placed in drive D:/. Mistakes
can occur if you don't do it right. The official clients can not be unpacked 
so easily, if the experience is missing, so it is best to look in Pserver area.
There are various clients that can still be unpacked with conventional
unpackers.

That is needed
-------------
    - Map
    - Textures
    - Textureset
    - Property
    - Environment
    - Zone
    - Tree

Method
-------
    - Select the map you want to edit
    - Copy the map and paste it into "ymir work".
    - Start WorldEditor now and load the map.

If you did everything right, and you didn't missing some files
the map is displayed correctly and you can edit them in peace.

Best regards
