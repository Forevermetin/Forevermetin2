Welcome to FAQ 1

So you want to set up WorldEditor and need my help? no problem.

[1] Create new partition
---------------------
To see the textures you need a new one Partition. You can also start the
program without a new partition, but then you won't see any textures.
Therefore, please create a new partition (drive) and give this letter "D". 
Of course, you can also take a USB stick and assign it the letter D.

With the version of MartySama you can also work without this drive, but
you need this drive not only for WorldEditor but also for npc's, items etc.

[2] Start Forever Metin2 in drive (D)
--------------------------------
It is best to start Forever Metin2 in drive (D). The tool does not make
any changes to your old ones Files. Only files that you don't have are
downloaded, everything else is left as it is.


[3] Choose what you want
------------------------
Download WorldEditor Pro or WorldEditor Clean I leave the choice to you.
What you just want to know is that I'm more likely to update worldeditor
clean than worldeditor pro.


[4] Unzip and get started
----------------------
Unzip the * .rar file with "Winrar" and off you go.
Don't you have a winrar Here is a link to Winrar:

Do you want an Empty WorldEditor?
---------------------------------
I can help you there as well. With the command:
 
 • /create worldeditor

Forever Metin2 export the following:

  - effect  (empty)
  - environment  (empty)
  - miles  (all you need)
  - pc  (all you need)
  - property   (empty)
  - special  (all you need)
  - terrainmaps  (empty)
  - textureset  (empty)
  - tree  (empty)
  - zone  (empty)
  - background_stone.gr2
  - devil.dll
  - grann29.dll
  - granny2.dll
  - ilu.dll
  - MSS32.dll
  - python27.dll
  - SpeedTreeRT.dll
  - MartySama44.exe

Create WorldEditor is good for people who want to do everything
themselves. Are you a beginner? Then it's best to use WorldEditor Clean.
You can combine WorldEditor Clean very well with "WorldEditor Work", the
two become later WorldEditor Gold. Right you see the statistics.

These statistics show you how many new objects, textures, etc. have been
added, apart from the original ymir work files.
