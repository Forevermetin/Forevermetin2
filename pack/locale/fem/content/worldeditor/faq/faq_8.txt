Welcome to FAQ 8

Implementing a map can be nervous because if you have forgotten something
small, you look for mistakes for a long time, even if only there on "." is missing.
The error output from the client is really sucks, even the long search.

Implement map how it works
---------------------------

[1] Unzip
--------
 - Root
 - Locale
 - Etc
 - Property
 - Zone
 - Tree
 - Environment

[2] Root & Locale
----------------
I still haven't understood it! For what needs to Root and Locale Atlas? I really
dont know that until today. Because of this system, it also happens more often
errors in the map implementation. In any you have to enter the coordinates here.

• metin2_map_a1	409600	896000	4	5

This is how the red map1 looks:

 • metin2_map_a1		the map (folder name)
 • 409600  896000		coordinates
 • 4	5		size

The coordinates can best be seen with KingSora's Generate tool. If you just take
blind coordinates there will be overlaps. That means if you get kicked off the map
you should know that the map overlaps with another. Therefore please use
KingSora's Tool. You dont have his tool? no problem, use this command: 

 - /export coordinator 

[3] Client procedure
------------------
Open the "atlasinfo.txt" and enter your coordinates, map size and map name and
save the file. The file is in root and locale:

 - locale/locale/*/atlasinfo.txt
 - root/atlasinfo.txt

The map comes in an extra patch or in one existing folder. If you want it clean it’s
best to make a new patch.

 - patch_map

The map and everything that comes with it comes in patch_map, or in the folder
you selected/created. Would you like to know how to insert the large minimap?

 - Command: /info minimap

You should also note the following:
--------------------------------
Everything must be in lower case in the map folder! WorldEditor likes to change
something here and there. 

The talk here is from the old worldeditor and not martysama versions. 

first create a .bat file and add the following lines and save it:

for /r %%x in (AreaAmbienceData.txt) do ren "%%x" areaambiencedata.txt
for /r %%x in (AreaData.txt) do ren "%%x" areadata.txt
for /r %%x in (AreaProperty.txt) do ren "%%x" areaproperty.txt
ping 127.0.0.1 -n 30>nul


Paste the .bat in the main folder of your map and start it. 

These files are mostly changed:

      - AreaAmbienceData.txt		> areaambiencedata.txt
      - AreaData.txt			> areadata.txt
      - AreaProperty.txt		> areaproperty.txt

Please check the Setting.txt file for mistakes. What is changed? the most is
"ViewRadius". Somehow it will save placed higher. default looks like this:
    
      - ViewRadius	128

[4] Procedure server
-------------------
Open the following:

 - /share/locale/*/map/index

There may be the following on the first lines:

 - 1	metin2_map_a1
 - 3	metin2_map_a3
 - 4	metin2_map_guild_01
 - 5	metin2_map_monkey_dungeon_11
 - 21	metin2_map_b1
 - 23	metin2_map_b3

So, we see the numbers on the left and the maps on the right. The numbers can
be chosen freely, but they are not allowed 2x Exist. The same applies to the map
name. Is called my map bsw. map_feuer_dungeon, that would be mine List look
like this:

 - 1	metin2_map_a1
 - 3	metin2_map_a3
 - 4	metin2_map_guild_01
 - 5	metin2_map_monkey_dungeon_11
 - 21	metin2_map_b1
 - 23	metin2_map_b3
 - 130	map_feuer_dungeon

This is not how my list should look!

 - 1	metin2_map_a1

 - 3	metin2_map_a3
 - 4	metin2_map_guild_01

 - 5	metin2_map_monkey_dungeon_11
 - 21	metin2_map_b1
 - 23	metin2_map_b3

 - 130	map_feuer_dungeon

If my list looks like this, the Npc's Ingame shown twice.

With the command:
 - /create mapfolder

Can you have a map folder created or Export. This is helpful and also saves 
time to create one yourself.

The following files are exported:
------------------------------
  • boss.txt
  • npc.txt
  • regen.txt
  • Setting.txt
  • stone.txt
  • Town.txt

All you have to do is adjust them.

When you are finished with the index, you can go to the next step. For this we
open a config, this is with many files other housed, with fly files would be
to find the config in game/channel1/Config

Open your Config and enter the map.

 - MAP_ALLOW: 1 3 4 5 21 23 24

An example config. No doubles are allowed here either numbers exist. The
number you entered in "Index" You got in here too. If you have a run or a map like
Weeding-map, then always add it to the event channel. As far as I know you have
to enter the runs like Blue Dragon run in channel99 to avoid lag.

Pack & restart
-------------
Restart the server "no reboot" and pack all Files you need for your map. If you
have everything done correctly, you should have no problems can log in. If not,
check your syserr clientside and serverside.
