Welcome to FAQ 10

At the old WorldEditor there was this Bug, where the area you are currently
texturing was white. It was because there was a limit textures that could be
used on a surface. So you could e.g. apply 3-4 textures to a surface without it
becoming white, and from 4+ fucked it up.

With the new WorldEditor/s this should not be
...and if you do..: 

This is how you can fix it:
-----------------------

 - L-Shift+0 = 255 textures
 - L-Shift+8 = 8 textures
 
You want to use 5 textures or more at once? Just select all textures you
want and it will become one texture.
