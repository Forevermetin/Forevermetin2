Show Sura and Ninja how it works
--------------------------------

So that you don't have to unzip or download I imported everything into
Forevermetin2. Which means you can have the files exported.

With the command:
 - /create worldeditor

Forever Metin2 exports everything you need. No other changes are anticipated.
The whole thing takes a few seconds, so please a little patience.
