Welcome to FAQ 2

Implementing your own objects using WorldEditor is quick and easy. 
You can also do it manually create properties with Notpad ++, but it's real
annoying, especially if you have over 100 objects.

Create property how it works
---------------------------

 - Open your WorldEditor
 - Load a map, no matter which
 - Go to page 3, the second [ V ]
 - Choose a folder
 - Now press "New Object"
 - Enter a name (so that you have the overview)

Wähle aus
----------
    • Tree	*.spt
    • Building	*.gr2
    • Effect	*.msa
    • Ambience	*.wav

Have you selected one now? Now confirm with Accept and the property is
created or that Object implemen-ted.

You can use the objects independently of WorldEditor to implement. You either
do it manually or you use the property coded by Artur Generator. Property
Generator is located in all packs. You can export "Property Generator" with
this comand: /export progen
