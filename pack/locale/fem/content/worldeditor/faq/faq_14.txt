Welcome to FAQ 14

Some objects have textures with them and others do not. If the 
textures are there and the objects don't have any or are white, just 
read on.

You can export the objects differently with 3ds max. one method is to 
include the texture in the .gr2 file, i.e. the model. I only recommend this
method for textures that are not used more than 10 times, otherwise it 
would be a waste of resources.

Otherwise, you choose a texture from any path such as ymir work / npc /.
Then all textures are exported, so you can also edit them, and change them 
if necessary without having to always export the .gr2.

What you can do:
----------------

 - Open your model with granny viewer.
 - Navigate to < Texture List >

so now check the paths. Below you see "Texture", here you can see if you 
have this texture and if it is in the right path.
