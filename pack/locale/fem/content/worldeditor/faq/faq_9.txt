Welcome to FAQ 9

WorldEditor is really unstable and crashes very often.
Mostly it crashes when editing effects and that sucks with time. 

We're not only talking about old but also all new WorldEditors.

The following are known to have crashes:

 - You choose a texture that doesn't exist.
     In other words, entered in the textureset but not
     matching .dds file to it. 

 - Select several objects at once. For me at least, it was 
     with the officials trees.

 - Keep the tool open too long. Therefore, please always 
     restart the tool after 15-30 minutes, or continue working
     until it crashes, but then please always save.

Best regards
