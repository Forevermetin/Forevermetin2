Welcome to FAQ 7

If you want an empty ATTR, so use please the Forevermetin2 ATTR-Creator.
Generally I recommend you to work with empty ATTR. The reason is simply:
WorldEditor. WorldEditor exports the correct ATTR, but it does postponed
collisions there. It leads to that in some places unwanted spawns occur or 
no spawns at all. I haven't tested it with MartySama v40 yet.

Create ServerAttr how it works
-----------------------------

 • Block: Neither player nor monster can enter this marker
 • Safe: This stands for the save zone
 • Water: You can fish & campfire is not possible at this point.

Have you edited the ATTR and want it now? Test or export?

 - Save ServerAttr
 
The file is saved in the map folder.

Since WorldEditor exports buggy ATTR, I have did the following when I mapped:

Create and use empty MDATR
---------------------------
Don't place the monsters sloppy, just here and there, over there and here. 
95% do that

I usually take the brush size 0, so it happens to fewer bugs.

ServerATTR is used twice, once by the server and clients. At the client, the
collisions are not postponed. By client I mean where the blockages are.
