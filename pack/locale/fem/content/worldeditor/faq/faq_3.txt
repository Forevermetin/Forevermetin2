Welcome to FAQ 3

Inserting textures is easy and not too annoying like remove objects on the map
individually. Therefore you have two methods. I will explain the simplest Method.

Insert textures like this
---------------------

 - Open your WorldEditor
 - Load a map, no matter which
 - Go to page 2, the first V
 - Click on "Texture brush" on Add texture
 - Choose a texture * .dds
 - CTRL + S
 - Now your texture is inserted

WorldEditor inserts the texture into your textureset and then always accesses
this texture set. If your WorldEditor crashes or a texture fails there is the best
way to check the texture set.
