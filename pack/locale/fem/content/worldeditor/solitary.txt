Solitary the lost Dungeon

This name, so Solitary comes from my favorite series One Piece. The
map itself, however, does not resemble the Solitary map in the One Piece
world.

Solitary is not a map, but a series of maps that belong to a single map. The
main map name is Solitary, and the subdivision are simply small sections of
it. It is a dungeon. For a Metin2 Pserver I made Solitary, but it was only at
30%, which means 60% map area was missing because the map was only
3 x 3 instead of 10 * 10. So over half of the map would be a dungeon, and
the rest would be an open map mixed with dungeons and ruins.

You can download the first version of the Solitary Map, including the
objects that can be found there. Textures and skybox are of course also
included. It is best to open the map in WorldEditor and see how I created
the map, so you can take it over quietly and it will be easier for you to map.
