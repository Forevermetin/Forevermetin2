Tutorial:
------
 - Select all objects that have an empty collision
 - Drag & Drop the objects onto the MDATR button
 - wait a few seconds

The MDATR is created, and is saved there where the GR2 files are located.

Note:
-----
FEM2 exports an empty MDATR and names it then around. 
It is an empty GR2 collision, and has no further effect on the game.
