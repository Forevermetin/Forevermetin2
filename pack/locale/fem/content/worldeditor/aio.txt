You are probably wondering what aio now means. Or have you already
interpreted something? I save you the trouble of thinking further, this is aio:

> fem_autodesk_ripper_set
  -----------------------
  Information about this pack can be found in the WorldEditor Section if you 
  have Forevermetin2. In large and whole there is as much in it as you need 
  to extract different games, so to export the objects and npcs.
  
> fem_officiall_objects_autodesk
  ------------------------------
  in this file you can find almost all metin2 objects as one .ms file. You 
  open MS files with Autodesk no matter which version. You can use these 
  files to edit and save the official objects.

> fem_worldeditor_clean_v3
  ------------------------
  This pack contains all objects of the official metin2 server. I have 
  re-sorted everything. this pack is here will only be updated via 
  Forevermetin2. In addition, this pack contains the world editor version 
  42 from MartySama. I recommend to continue working with this pack here 
  and to report any errors that arise.
