Can I use other people's objects and then sell the map?

Here, too, the answer is: yes

Everything that has to do with metin2, none of the Pserver scene has rights,
unless it is a system or something else. You can use models and everything
else without thinking. If you are a correct person, you indicate who exported
these objects and state this in credits.

Caution: We are talking about objects that have been taken over from other
games.


Kind regards
