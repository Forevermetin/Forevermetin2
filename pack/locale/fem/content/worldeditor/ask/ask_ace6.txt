Is it legal to sell maps?


The question is simply answered: No.

The files that can be found in a map folder are Photoshop and text files,
nobody has the right to them as soon as you create them from 0.

Objects that do not come from Ymir have no rights to them because they 
were not created by themselves. 

Unless, as already said, we create the models from 0.

Kind regards
