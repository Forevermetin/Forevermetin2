Is it legal to sell maps?


The question is simply answered: No.

The files that can be found in a map folder are Photoshop and text files, nobody
has the right to them as soon as you create them from 0.

Objects that do not come from Ymir have no rights to them because they were
not created by themselves. Whether it's me, or Plechito or whoever, the objects
never entirely belong to us. 

Unless, as already said, we create the models from 0.
