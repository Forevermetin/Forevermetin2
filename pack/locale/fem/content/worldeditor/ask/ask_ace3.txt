Is there a magic trick to make the maps look nice?

There are various tips and tricks to get good maps. One of the best tricks 
is the size of the map and the objects. So if you have a small map, you place
small objects, but if you have a large map, it is advantageous to keep the
objects larger. I was able to use this trick on all of my maps. 

What is also very important is the skybox, i.e. the lighting. The skybox or
environment is very important for a map. Important if the look of the map 
is important to you. 

Let your fantasy run wild and don't think that something looks crooked or 
not at all. Sometimes it's things that only we see and not the others.

Kind regards
