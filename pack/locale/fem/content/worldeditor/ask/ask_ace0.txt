How or where do I best start with a map?

The question of how best to start is answered differently and it can lead
to confusion. Personally, I always start with the job which should look the
most beautiful. 

Example: 
For a Map1 I start with the City. As soon as I finish the city, I
start designing outside. It doesn't matter how big the map is.

Farmmaps are the easiest, depending on the size of the map. 
If the map is very small, I start in the middle. If the map is very 
large, so I start at the top and work my way down. You can of course 
Start in the middle, 

With a 1 × 1 - 2 × 2 map you can start from the middle. From a size of 
3 × 3 it would make sense to have one who takes corners. Either at the
top right / left or at the bottom right / Left. If I start at the top right, the
players have to run all the way to the bottom / middle to get to a boss.

With dungeons, I always start at a corner. Either top right / left or bottom 
right left. For dungeons, by the way, I have uploaded a package which you
can download for free. It is a Dungeon Set which I used and published for
Solitary for a long time have.

Please note the following for all maps:
There should be enough space between the player and the end, so 
Player doesn't see the ending and this is better received.

And the most important thing when mapping: After you have finished 
your layout, first place the objects on the map and then you start texturing.
