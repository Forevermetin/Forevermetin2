What should I consider when mapping?

There are no limits to your creativity, but Metin2 does. You shall know that too
much detail can lead to lags. Most lagged .spt and .mse (MDE) files, i.e. trees and
effects. But there are also objects that can lead to lags, very large objects. I
don't know much about to give even more information on this.

Just make sure that you know what you are placing on your map. It brings not if
you place objects on your map without a plan. Choose it wisely and think about
why the object should be placed here. At the beginning it is difficult, otherwise
the map will look empty, but you will Realize over time that you don't necessarily
to have 1000 trees there, so that the map looks good.
