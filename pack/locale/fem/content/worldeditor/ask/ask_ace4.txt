Is it worth mapping? Can I earn anything with it?

The answer is clear: yes

You can do a lot with WorldEditor and Mapping if you have the contacts. 
If you do not have these contacts as a Conection, it will be rather difficult to
get rid of your map for a good price.

You can send me your map with all the files that belong to it so that it is
functional. I'll take a look at them and let you know if I can forward you to 
a customer.

Kind regards
Ace
