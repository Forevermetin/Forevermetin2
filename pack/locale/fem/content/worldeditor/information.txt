WorldEditor
-----------
Metin2 WorldEditor is a program / tool with which you can create maps for the
game Metin2. The program WorldEditor or abbreviation "WE", was published
when Metin2 had a leak. I don't know if anyone had it before. Before WorldEditor
appeared, most of them worked with Photoshop and then Metin2 Map Tool v.1.4,
encoded by BlackYuko, at this point I want to thank everyone who has coded such
tools, thank you even if it is old BlackYuko. There are other programs, but I have
forgotten the names. But what bad luck too.

Publication
----------
After everything was released, several DEV's brought WorldEditor up and
running made available to the community. The most used of all versions
available is the WorldEditor Remix v24 by MartySama. well as far as I could see
in many videos and screens.
