Creating your own server is the easiest thing
Before you publish your map, please look at it several times ingame
If you get stuck, don't give up right away. Keep trying or visit metin2dev
If you need map resources, take a closer look at forevermetin2
Watch what you download from any boards. It is best to always make backups of your own files
Help each other because this is the only way metin2 will survive
Many thanks to kingsora for this nice ui design
