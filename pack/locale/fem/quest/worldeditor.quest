If you want to learn like I did, start with a 1x1 map and climb up
You can find many of my objects in zone under the folder shyeonline
Don't use too many mde files on a single surface. This can lead to lag for players with bad computers
Mapping is easier than you think. Time, motivation, creativity and ideas are the only things that lead you to success
Try to work with details. If you are placing a house, place a table or chair next to it. You can also put a cart behind the house or a small box next to it
AIO is a starter set. If you start from 0, I recommend that you download this
If you want to create a temple, I recommend switching on the "snap" function
